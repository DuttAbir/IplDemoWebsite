        <h1>TOURNAMENT</h1>
        <p>
            Currently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away round-robin format in the 
            league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. 
            The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, 
            with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the 
            IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase
             play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the 
             first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner 
             of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.
        </p>
        <h2>Match Rules</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>Some of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:</h3>
            <ul id="l2">
                <li> The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.</li>
                <li> Salary cap of the entire squad must not exceed ₹850 million (US$12 million).</li>
                <li> Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.</li>
                <li> A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            IPL games utilise television timeouts and hence there is no time limit in which teams must complete their 
            innings. However, a penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team is given 
            a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team between 
            the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th overs.
            Since the 2018 season, the Umpire Decision Review System is being used in all IPL matches,
             allowing each team one chance to review an on-field umpire's decision per innings.
        </p>
        <h2>Prize Money</h2>
        <p>
            The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of ₹500 million (US$7.0 million), 
            with the winning team netting ₹200 million (US$2.8 million). The first and second runners up received 
            ₹125 million (US$1.8 million) and ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million), respectively, with the fourth placed team
             also winning ₹87.5 million (US$1.2 million).[37] The other teams are not awarded any prize money. 
             The IPL rules mandate that half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.
